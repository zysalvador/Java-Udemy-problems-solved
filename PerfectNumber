// NOTE: This operator % is used to do the basic math in order to confirm if the number is Perfect since a positive number is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.  
If a number is a divisor of another number, then the remainder of the division is zero.

In the case of checking if a number is perfect, we need to find all the proper divisors of a number.
Proper divisors are all the divisors of a number except for the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.
